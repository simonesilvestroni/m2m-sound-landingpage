    quote: 'Simone mixed my band’s latest two albums. I worked closely with him during this process, using his Trello-based methodology to help sequence the work. Each song appeared as a series of tasks to be completed, checked and commented on. As a result, we were able to manage our time smoothly and efficiently. Creative ideas flowed back and forth. I’m looking forward to involving him in the next recordings!'

    quote: 'What’s always impressed me about Simone is his attention to detail, which he demonstrates in every area of his work. Not only is he a prolific producer and bassist, but he easily comprehends and executes on the most abstract concepts across tech, audio, marketing, branding, and visual arts. When you work with Simone, everything is down, documented, and organised, which makes it very easy to work with him directly or in the context of a team. '

    quote: 'In the band I started, Simone was the most involved with regards to arrangement and dynamics. Using his fretless bass, he completely switched the mood of any given part. Simone and I have been working on my new releases, and it’s been an incredibly worthwhile experience. It’s great to have him with me to lead the production side and also to influence the arrangement. I’m really happy to have a producer that understands completely my process as a songwriter.'
